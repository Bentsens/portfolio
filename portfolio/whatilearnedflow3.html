            <p>In these "what-i-learned" sections, i would like to recap the different flows and sum up what i have learned during them.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In flow three, i learned a great amount of information regarding user interface, concept development and different kind of user tests. We learned how to make website easier to navigate on, and how to create an overview so the user do
              not feel lost on a site. Furthermore we tried different user tests on different sites to see the power each individual test hold, and how you can use the respond/results your get from those to improve a site. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When we created our apps, we learned the importance of concept development through tools such as brainstorming, negative-brainstorming, flowcharts etc. in order structure and filter ideas. </p>
            <br>

            <p>Even though my skills in illustrator are not the greatest, vector graphic wasnt a new sight to me. With the assignment of building an app, i had decided to only utilize illustrator in order to gain more experience in the software. This
              resulted in feeling a lot more comfortable with its tools.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In this specific flow i was hoping to learn about creating better user interfaces and user experiences, as those are key features behind good visual communication. With the above mentioned techniques i feel that, that goal has been
              achieved.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I really want to know more about design principles, such as the use of negative space, logo design etc. This is because i find those visual aspects very interesting and powerful when creating content in general.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I really want to learn more about some of the above mentioned topics. Therefore i have started to watch a great amount of tutorials and online lectures so i can keep moving forward and stay in touch with the trends.</p>
