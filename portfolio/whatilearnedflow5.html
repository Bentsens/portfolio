          <div class="breadtext">
            <p>In these "what-i-learned" sections, i would like to recap the different flows and sum up what i have learned during them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In conclusion this has been the most challenging assignment I have had so far. It really required time and work to be managed properly, in order to keep track of everything. The assignment really benefited from all the tools learned
              throughout the semester, whether it was design theory to creating a video.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With that being said, I really enjoyed it. It kept requiring me to push my own limits and work harder, which made me a lot more confident in my own skills and content creations. Just how much I learned in such a short amount of time
              made it all worth it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I hope we will learn more about websites in the future. How to properly use Javascript etc. which could help in creating more complex designs and features. In addition, I would like to learn more about designing logos specifically,
              reasons be that it has already been a hobby of mine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This assignment has really sparked my interest for designing and coding websites, and I hope I can keep creating such content in the future. </p>
