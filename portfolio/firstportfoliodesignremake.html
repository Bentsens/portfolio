              <br>
              <p>For the remake of my first portfolio i have chosen to utilize some of the key features from the last portfolio, still trying to keep it somewhat minimalistic and modern</p>
              <br>
              <p>Before actually designing the mockup for the new portfolio, i created some basic wireframes, so i could keep the portfolio within my coding limits, and get a sense of layout. It was clear from the response i got from the last portfolio that it lacked personality as the model on the frontpage was not me. Therefore i wanted to create my wireframes around that. Next i planted some call-to-action-buttons which intentions was to activate the user of the website. Next i wanted to showcase more than three projects, as that was some of the response i got from presenting it at school.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In this rendition i wanted some more colors, as i found the last portfolio being too dull and grey. I wanted it to utilize some of the same grey professional look while still being able to have some color in it. I have chosen to use a gunmetal grey for the primary color and a light blue as the secondary color. The color really helped bring some more life into the portfolio. I masked an image of myself out and cut it so it is looking as im leaning against the grey area. Next i put som shadow behind the image from myself to help create the illusion of the light blue actually being a wall, and gradient-vibe. Next problem was the solid colors did not have any texture, that problem was later fixed by adding very suttle noise the solid blocks of grey and blue.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I have only put two major elements on the frontpage (text and image) so there wouldnt be to many objects battling for the eyes attention. The text on the frontpage is in two different sizes in order to create a hierarchy. That way i can creat focus on the part saying "i'm Frederik", so the user knows whos portfolio they are visiting. </p>
              <br>
              <p>The navigation bar is relative simple with the navigation itself on the left side, and the social-media icons on the right side.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The fonts used throughout the remake is kept to two different fonts: Quicksand and Nevis which are two of my favorite fonts and why they will be seen in most of my projects. Nevis in my portfolio are used on things that are needed to be emphasized or headlines/titles, while Quicksand is mostly used for the body text.</p>
