          </ul>
          <div class="breadtext">
            <p>In these "what-i-learned" sections, i would like to recap the different flows and sum up what i have learned during them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In flow four its was alot about struturing, managing and optimizing group projects. This is particular effective when creating larger projects in groups, so everyone gets involved and know it their function. We learned how to use
              different group management tools such as PBS, WBS, Gantt-charts etc. and how to effectively apply them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The PBS is very useful to create a hierarchical structure where the main product/project is placed to be the top level. The next level would be the building blocks and components that creat that level above it. Therefore this can be
              used to break a product down to its very last tiny component, which is helpful when needed to create a major product.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The WBS takes a similar approach, but here it is the work that are structured. This could almost be called a sophistical version of a to-do-list. This lays focus on the work required, and not the components.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was in this flow we also learned that alot of companies has design-guidelines in form of reports avaible to the public. This is particular practical when we are creating concepts for different companies. To follow such a guideline
              proved it self to be a very useful exercise, to constantly return to the brief to see if your product is kept within the given lines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I knew before coming into this flow, that when creating design such as logos etc. for proffesional companies its very important to keep checking if your logo is within the design brief, that they may have given you. For an example i
              dont want to be creating a logo showing sympathy for a sports team, because that is not what a sports team typical want they brand to represent. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to learn more about managing group projetcs, as i always felt that i rather wanted to work alone rather than a in group. With this project i am now of a different school, i am still convinced that i rather want to work alone
              than in a poorly managed grou project. With that said, i also now believe that with just a little effort put into laying down a gameplan as we did, group projects a the far superior way to go.</p>
