            <p>In these "what-i-learned" sections, i would like to recap the different flows and sum up what i have learned during them.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In the first flow it was much about the introduction to designing af creating content using different software like Adobe XD and Photoshop. Further more we were also introduced to color and design theory. In this flow with our Photoshop intro assignment, i really spend a lot of time getting familiar with the vast variety of tools and different applications they have. Also here i got a better understanding of the major pros in having a none-destructive workflow, which have really helped on my work in photoshop in general.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When designing our first portfolio i quickly realised the importance of thr princips behind the AIDA model, creating a hierarchy, typography etc. Furthermore i learned how sketching and drawing wireframes on raw paper can help visualising the end product one is trying to achieve. In addition the introduction the prototype building was a completely new experience for me. I have always just kept my designs inside either photoshop or illustrator, but i learned creating a prototype in XD can be a really helpful step towards seeing the finished product.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Before starting on Multimediadesign, i have always had an interest in creating visuel content. Therefore i had already been working with programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop. The photoshop intro assignment could have been done in a short time, but by picking up a harder task that still fit the task requirements, it really pushed me to learn more about the program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With none to very little experience with design and color theory, i learned to put words and arguments behind the design choices i now make. Which is a especially perk to be in possesion of when talking about design to with others.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In this flow i expected to learn about photoshop and a bit of design theory and those goals were well met. I now feel more confident in workflow and in the content that i create.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I would love to learn more about design theory, and especially more about typography, as i feel those are key aspects to creating beautiful design.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In order for me to learn more, i will have to listen closely to the respond that i get, and adjust to it. For now in order to push myself to learn more of about those things, i will keep creating and using content creating software in my spare time. </p>
