            <div class="test3">
              <p>(Hover the image to see the old app)</p>
              <br>
              <p>When remaking my old prototype of an app, i could quickly see alot of design flaws in an instant.</p>
              <br>
              <p>First of all, there was a lot of places throughout the old design where i things was poorly placed, not enough space around and no room for the objects to breathe. For an example it its very clear to see the improvements already on the login-pages. On the old design the title was way to close to the front-logo. Same issues goes for the subtitle, being to close to "MobileGift", which also in the old design was too big. Such problems created uneseccary disturbance. This was fixed by adding more space between each element and reducing the font-size of the subtitle, which resulted in a better flow, hierarchy and a more clean design on the pages.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Next i reduced the different types of fonts from four to two, now only using PayType (MobilePay's own) and Quicksand in different weights, to keep an overall cleaner design.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With the knowledge of that MobilePay had a design-guide avaible for the public, i change the colors throughout the whole app, to keep within the existing guidelines.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I had an idea of creating a more simple keyboard, but not really knowing how. Some thoughts later, back and forth between different styles and concepts i came to a conclusion. I knew i wanted a white keyboard, but that was hard to see on a white background. The grids within the keyboard could help that, but i did not like the look of it. This resulted in removing the grid and adding a drop-shadow to the keyboard to make it stand of the already white background.</p>
              <br>
              <p>One of the last things done to the remake, was recreating some of the icons, to fit the theme of the logo. Since the logo is representing a 3D box, i wanted the new icons have more depth than previous. This goal was maily achieved by using different types of whites and blues. </p>
