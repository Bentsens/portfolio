              <p>In our first attempt of coding an acutal website, we were given the task to code our own portfolio. Here i used the first edition of my portfolio design as a template, and goal to achieve.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The requirements for the assigment was as below stated:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Upload an online version of you portfolio to your webhotel</li>
                <li>Create a repository for your portfolio project</li>
                <li>A fitting project structure (filename, folders)</li>
                <li>A flawless code (validated)</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>When it came to coding my "dream-portfolio" i quickly realised that my previous design, was at that point out, of my coding skills. Therefore i had to cut the design down to my own limitations in order to complete the assignment. I would still keep the first design as a template, and with it its layout.</p>
              <br>
              <p>First problem i ran into was the background. I couldnt make the background fit the screen, and after spending too much time of the same problem, i had to move forward. I ended up with an alternative solution, which was to create a solid background color (grey) and crop out an image that i could place at the bottom center. With this solution the same layout was still kept, but with a slightly more boring and dull look.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Next i was trying to place the title on the left side on the front figure, which i ended up just centering above it instead.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Also on the frontpage i was needed to get rid of the blurry glass panel at the bottom right. Simply due to the fast i was not able figure out how to create the glass-effect.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Beside the issues mentioned above, the frontpage stayed more or less the same, with a navebar representing the original pretty good.</p>
              <br>
              <p>For the rest of the pages on the site, the layout and overall look was kept the same as the original, but only lacking the window/glass panel effect again.</p>
