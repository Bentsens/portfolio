            <div class="test3">
              <p>In this project i were to now code the portfolio remake design. At this point i felt a lot more confident in my coding skills, and could therefore, more or less recreate my mockup 1:1 in HTML and CSS.</p>
              <br>
              <p>On the frontpage i simply save the background image from my mockup design, and got it to fit the screen this time. Here i was faced with a minor issue regarding my nav bar. Since i created the mockup in a way that the navbar looks like it is a part of the background on the frontpage, i had to set the background color of the nav bar to the same as the background image. This was proven to be more difficult that previous expected as the color code from photshop does not represent the same color on the web. I then checked the color profiles in photshop, to get a better representation of the colors, tried set the colors in css using RGB code, but without luck. That is also the reason, if you look closely enough one can spot a difference in the blue colors on the background and navbar.  </p>
              <br>
              <p>The next slight change from the mockup to the coded website is on the layout page. Normally the title projects would have been alligned to the left, above the leftside project. I changed this mainly because i liked it better being in the center. Next i got rid of the body text under "Projects". Reasons behind that was due to the lack of function it actually had.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I changed the sizing on the showcase gallery a tiny bit, but not really noticeable. This showcase layout was created by using a "diplay: grid;" which properties and functions i have grown very fond of. Which is why i also utilize its abilites alot throughout my projects</p>
              <br>
              <p>The rest of the pages is a 1:1 recreation of the mockup with some generic lorem-ipsum text on the about page and a simple contactform, again created with grids.</p>
