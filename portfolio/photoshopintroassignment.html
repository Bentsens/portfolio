            </ul>
            <div class="test3">
              <p>This is for our first assignment, which was an introduction to photshop. In this assignment we had to use photoshop to manipulate a photo taken on our fieldtrip. Worth mentioning that i worked a fair amount in photoshop before this assigment was given.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The requirements for the assigment was as below stated:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Remove an element: some on the picture has to be removed, and the whole you create in which to do so has to be recovered so it match the original image</p></li>
                <li><p>Add an element: Something that was not on the original image has to be added, so it looks like it was there from the beginning</p></li>
                <li><p>Correct light or add an atmosphere byusing filters or color correction</p></li>
                <li><p>Crop the image and maybe adjust the image rotation</p></li>
                <li><p>Format and size: The image has to be in format 4:3 and saves so the siez is â‰¦ 1 M pixel</p></li>
                <li><p>Upload the original, unedited image side by side with you own edited version</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>I have chosen to use the first listed image of an old wrecked car, because i had the idea of restoring it. In the process of doing so i ended up with using all of my skills in photoshop.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In quick summery, i masked out the car so i could reduce the height of it. I removed all of the stickers by eyedropping nearby colors of the car, and then repainted the cars body. Then i applied a layer of texture to the body by sampling a piece of oxidated metal and laying it on top of the car parts with an overlay. With a destroyed front bumper, i took a front bumper from another old car and resized it to fit with transfom and perspective. I also added new headlights and wheels with the same method. The windows is simply just painted in there with different colors and opacity applied to the brush tool. I wanted to keep the "wrecked-look" so i did not refurbish the car door, instead i drew som metal pipes. Then some of the last touches was simply to change the background, add some smoke behind the car, and apply a camera raw filter.</p>
