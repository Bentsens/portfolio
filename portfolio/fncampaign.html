              <p>This project was about creating a campaign for a company in collaboration with FN Global Goals. It was also our first assignment we had to create in groups consisting of 3-4 people.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The requirements for the assignment was as below stated:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Choose a company with an already existing style-guide avaible to the public</li>
                <li>Choose next the Global Goals that makes sense to the company</li>
                <li>Create a campaign landingpage and video by re-designing or adapt the companys and global goals identity, in which you communicate the company and goals best way possible</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>Below you will be able to see our campaign video that we created to the project:</p>
              <object width="500" height="281" class="videoembed" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlhGMmQpHTE"></object>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>By brainstorming and mindmapping we decided to devlop further on my idea, that had also created my app from flow three. Therefore we chose MobilePay as our company and global goal 13 as our starting point. So the concept is still being able to donate money to a healthier environment through a payment/gift app. </p>
              <br>
              <p>As this was our first group project the planning of our workflow was important. We started of by creating the objective breakdown structure (OBS), this was done to get a better understanding of what we wanted the the group project to achieve. Next we created a work breakdown structure (WBS) to get a feeling of what we needed to create and in what order to achieve our goals.</p>
              <br>
              <p>By creating wireframes and storyboards we got a visual idea of the what we wanted the end-product to look like. Both of these were taking starting points in the styleguide.</p>
              <br>
              <p>To see the complete process of creating this project i highly recommend viewing the full report and XD prototype.</p>
