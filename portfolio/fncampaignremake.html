              <p>In the remake of the FN Campaign I have decided to take a different approach when it came to the video. I kept the original concept, a campaign for MobilePay where you through their app could donate to a healthier environment. For that reason, I also kept the original Landingpage as I thought it did not need much change and in doing so I have put all my energy the video instead.</p>

              <object width="500" height="281" class="videoembed" data="https://youtube.com/embed/wVc6R5QR14Q"></object>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>The response we got from the old video was very clear. It was too short, which made it hard to understand the story we were trying to tell with it. With that in mind I started out with trying to brainstorm a story. I watched a lot of great commercials from big companies, to see how they were doing it, and this is inspired by one of Nikes. My concept was to tell a story with out giving the “plot” away in the beginning, have the user to wanting to see it through to the end. Also, I wanted to create fictional group that the user could be a part of if they chose to donate through the app, to making them want to donate (example: when you tell the viewer they can be a winner by choosing Axe deodorant).</p>
              <br>
              <p>To develop further on above mentioned ideas, I wanted to go with a hero theme. To demystify a hero, to tell that everyone can be a hero, to tell that not all heroes wear a cape nor being able to fly etc, to tell that you can be a hero too by donating to a healthy environment through MobilePay. The idea here was to show a lot of normal people, that have donated money through MobilePay, to tell that they may not be looking like heroes, but they are.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With that being settled, I started to work on the script and storyboard. Also, some of the response we got last time was that it would have been nice if one were speaking the story. Therefore, I had a friend of mine to speak my script, as my own voice do not qualify for that. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Due to limitations, and not owning a camera, I used stockvideos to match my desired storyboard. It was clear to me through inspiration just how important sound effects are. Wherefore I have sampled a lot of different background sound effects to match each individual frame. I later laid some inspirational background music to fit the hero theme.</p>
              <br>
              <p>These are all of the thoughts, and work that went behind the campaign video showcased above.</p>
