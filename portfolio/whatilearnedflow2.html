            <p>In these "what-i-learned" sections, i would like to recap the different flows and sum up what i have learned during them.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In the second flow, we were introduced to HTML5 and CSS3. It was in this flow that the very first building block of this website itself was being taught to me. We learned the very basics behind coding in HTML and its capabilities. I were introduced to the way of thinking when building a website. For an example i always try visualize the website in containers in order for me to get an idea of how to code it. Furthermore the importance of pen and paper when sketching. This was especially important when it came to the styling part</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next we would be looking into CSS and the styling behind a site. Learned the fundamentals in styling and how to place objects where you would like them to go. In addition to that we also learned the power of different lines of code, like displaying objects flex, justifying its content within, styling on different classes, giving containers multiple classes, things like parents and childrens etc. </p>
            <br>

            <p>I came into this flow with zero knowledge about HTML and CSS. In this flow i really felt that i needed to stay sharp in order to keep up. Which was change of pace when coming out of flow 1. At one point i felt like i falling behind since there were so much new information to grasp, but in my own opinion i think i managed to pull through </p>
            <br>

            <p>In this flow i expected to learn about setting up a simple website, and how to manage it. </p>
            <br>

            <p>I want to learn more about the power of CSS and what it is really capable of in order to creating stunning websites. Semantic html was one the things we were introduced to which i also want to learn more about, so i can provide meaning behind the code rather than just the presentation.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I hope than we will get more in touch with HTML and CSS, as i can still find myself confused when trying to achieve a certain design. That is why i hope that my understanding and skills on this subject will keep growing as i update my portfolio throughout the education. </p>
